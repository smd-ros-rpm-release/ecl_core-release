%description
Timing utilities are very dependent on the system api provided for their use.
This package provides a means for handling different timing models. Current
support - posix rt : complete. - macosx : posix timers only, missing absolute
timers. - win : none.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
